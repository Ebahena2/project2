  <h1>Locations I've Traveled to</h1>
  <div>
    <h2>Paris</h2>
    <p>I traveled to Paris, France with my family in 2015. This was always like a dream vacation spot for us because we would always see it on tv and look at pictures, and it all looked to nice</p>
    <p>We were there for about a week and we managed to visit some of the best tourist attractions in Paris, as well as walk throughout the streets of paris and visist some shops and boulangeries</p>
    <p>Below are a list of places that we visisted during out stay there</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Eiffel Tower, and went all the way to the top of it</li>
      <li>Louvre Museum</li>
      <li>Arc de Triomphe</li>
      <li>Palace of Versailles</li>
      <li>TheCatacombs of Paris</li>
      <li>Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Paris</li>
      <li>Disney Pairs</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I'm sure I'm forgetting some more places we visited there but those are some to name a few, it was a wonderful experience. Our first time overseas and it was an unforgettable time</p>

    <h2>Cancun, Mexico</h2>
    <p>Cancun has been a go to vacation destination for my family and I. We've been here multiple times</p>
    <p>Everytime we go here it is just a blast, we usually will stay in an all inclusive hotel where food and beverages are included</p>
    <p>This trip usually conists of going on different excursions which are kind of like amusement parks</p>
    <p>This destination is for sure the funnest out of all the places I've been because of all the different adrenaline inducing adventures as well as the drinking age is lowered in Mexico which made it more fun</p>
    <p>Below are some things that we did while there</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Swimming with Sharks</li>
      <li>Zip Linning</li>
      <li>Visisted Pyramids</li>
      <li>Went to see the Zenotes</li>
      <li>Visited Xcaret, Xplor Fuego, Xenses, Xel-Ha(All themeparks with different activities)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Will be going back there soon, possibly this year because of how amazing the scenary is in Cancun, Mexico and because my family is from there we feel comfortable being around spanish speaking locals</p>

    <h2>Los Cabos, Mexico</h2>
    <p>This was the most recent trip. Another part of Mexico. Los Cabos is located under California.</p>
    <p>I remember this the best as it was the most recent trip I've been to. This was more of a relaxing experiece compared to Cancun</p>
    <p>Instead of all the themeparks and exploration, this trip consisted of site seeing, enjoying the culture there and a rented yacht that took us to see the famous strucuture in Cancun and whales</p>
    <p> Below are just some pictures taken by me during our trip there</p>

    <h2>Inside the Country Trips</h2>
    <p>Inside the USA I've been to Orlando, Florida | Las Vegas, Nevada | Niagra Falls, New York</p>
    <p>Las Vegas was the most boring trip I've ever taken. Due to the fact that I was about 14 years old and couldn't do anything there.</p>
    <p>So theres not much content from there apart from site seeing and exploring the strip walking</p>
    <p>In Orlando we went to experience the Disney World Parks and Universal Studios.</p>
    <p>We visised the following parks</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Magic Kingdom</li>
      <li>Hollywood Studios</li>
      <li>Univseral Studios</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here are some pictures from my trip to Florida</p>

    <p>Then Niagra falls was just a weekened road trip we took to see the water falls and that was cool aswell but nothing too exciting</p>
    <p>Here's a picture I took while we had a tour of within the waterfalls</p>
